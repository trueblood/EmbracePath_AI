# Emotion Detection AI Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions. The project includes two versions of the notebook: one with extensive comments for learning purposes and a cleaned-up version for streamlined execution. Plus an API to host the AI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system, preferably Python 3.8 or above.
- Install Jupyter Notebook or use Jupyter Lab to run the notebooks.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py

### Notebooks Overview
Emotion_Detection_AI_v2: This is the original version of the notebook, which includes detailed comments explaining each step of the code. It's ideal for those who are learning about CNNs and emotion detection algorithms.

Emotion_Detection_AI_v3: This notebook is the cleaned-up version, removing verbose comments for a more straightforward code flow. It's suited for those who already understand the basics and want a cleaner version for modifications or direct use.

### Contributions
